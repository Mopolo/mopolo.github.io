SupFarm is a project created at Supinfo Paris by a group of four students (including me).

It is a multiplayer game in wich you manage a farm and fight the other farmers! There are random events handled by the server like rain, players can conquer territories, plant seeds and watch them grow.

The server runs on <kbd>Node.js</kbd>, the client display uses the librairy <kbd>KineticJS</kbd> and communications are handled by <kbd>Socket.io</kbd>.
