The Nouvel Obs is a french paper and online magazine.

I worked both on the frontend and the backend:

- Home made PHP framework
- Started and helped the transition from SVN to Git
- Setup of an internal Gitlab
- Creation of a backoffice to manage zones (parts of pages) to help 
redactors organise layouts with a visual UI
- Worked on the complete refactor of the Article page
- Discovery of Docker as a dev environment
