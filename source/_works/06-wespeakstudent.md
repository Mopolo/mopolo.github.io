WeSpeakStudent is the first big project I worked on at Osedea.<br />
<br />
This project has many aspects like:
<ul>
    <li>The website is responsive and allows student to pay insurrance using Stripe</li>
    <li>The backend (called Pulse) allows the company to manage everything</li>
    <li>Each school on the platform has a mobile app on iOs and Android</li>
    <li>These apps are built using <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a></li>
    <li>Here's one for example: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/cambrian-student-life/id906025355?mt=8">iOs</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wespeakstudent.cambrian">Android</a></li>
    <li>Students can manage the app content on a platform called Pulse Mobile</li>
    <li>The website is fully translated in English and French</li>
</ul>
